Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"

Tinuke OmolewaTOPIC: Application of Cybernetics for a new Paradigm in Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity PRESENTER: Dr. (Mrs.) Oladele, Tinuke Omolewa Department of Computer Science, College of Science and Engineering, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State. ABSTRACT Security entails protection of a person, building, organization or country against threats or attacks by any form of opposition. The trio of Cyber Security, Food Security and Biosecurity are global issues that have constituted great challenges worldwide. Developing more secure systems is paramount as computers are further integrated into everyday life and is used to store increasing amounts of sensitive data. Over time, research has identified that deficiencies are found in the existing security tools and measures. The application of Cybernetics will be used in this study to fill the gap and provide a new framework established from proven mathematical constructs that will serve as the basis to develop a new class of (cyber) security solutions. Cybernetics is the study of evolution, adaptation and control of systems. It is relevant to mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems. The cybernetic control model is a model that provides a framework for the study of the control of any system. The aim of this study is to develop a cybernetic system for controlling and managing (regulating) security risks in cyber security, food security and biosecurity. The specific objectives to realize this aim are to: (i) develop a cybernetic control model for integrating and controlling cyber security, food security and biosecurity and (ii) simulate the model using R. The methodology includes an indepth study of control theory, systems theory, feedback mechanisms and regulatory systems in the context of cybernetics.\n                    \n                     Thu27, Mar \n                    \n                        Seminar Presentation by Mr. Oguntayo SundayCenter for Learning Resources Seminar Presentation by Mr Oguntayo Sunday\nTOPIC: AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RDA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES IN NIGERIA\nDATE:Wednesday, 27th March, 2017, TIME: 2.30 pm prompt VENUE: Escapist Section, CLR\nABSTRACT\nThis paper is aimed at determining the level of awareness, knowledge and implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA) in academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis study adopted the survey approach method applicable to the target population, the entire academic librarians in Nigeria.\nThe total enumeration sampling technique was used to draw the sample for the study. All academic librarians registered on Nigerian Library Association (NLA) online forum formed the sample of the study.\nThe paper reveals that majority used at least two cataloguing tools out of many listed. 78 participants (88%) had heard about RDA while 11 (12%) had not. About 44% of the participants had the knowledge of RDA while 56% did not know that the rules were formally released in 2010. On the platform of implementation, only about 22% of the participants confirmed that their libraries are already implementing RDA while about 78% affirmed that lack of expertise/skills, inadequate budgets/finance and retrospective conversions of records constrained their libraries to use RDA.\nThis implies that lack of expertise and skills was the major constraint to the use and implantation of RDA in Nigerian academic libraries. Over 83% of the participants indicated that RDA may never be implemented in their libraries because they felt it was too cumbersome to use while others say they had no option than to implement RDA.\nConsequently, conferences and workshops were identified as major source of awareness for cataloguers. Nigerian Library Association (NLA) granted the Cataloguing, Classification and Indexing Section permission to sensitize over 500 librarians that attended NLA conference on the need to implement RDA in Academic libraries in Nigeria.\nThis paper recommends that RDA should be incorporated in the curriculum of library schools in Nigeria.\n                    \n                \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Close"
